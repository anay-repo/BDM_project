## ❓ Problem Statement

This project was initiated to address critical business challenges identified through preliminary discussions and analysis of the store's operations.

### 🔴 Key Challenges
- **Dead Stock Accumulation:** Premium brand inventory was sitting unsold, locking up significant capital and valuable shelf space.
- **Profit Stagnation:** The store's weekly profit was consistent but stagnant, hovering around **₹20,777**, which limited opportunities for growth and reinvestment.
- **Manual Record-Keeping:** All sales and inventory data were recorded manually in a `Khata Book`, making systematic analysis and forecasting nearly impossible.

## 🔬 Analytical Approach

A structured analytical approach was used to convert raw, unstructured data into strategic insights.

| Analysis Type | Action & Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Descriptive Statistics** | Calculated sums and averages to identify the top-performing and underperforming product brands. |
| **Trend Analysis** | Analyzed aggregated sales data by day of the week to uncover patterns in customer footfall and purchasing behavior. |
| **ABC Segmentation** | Classified all inventory into **A (High-Value)**, **B (Moderate-Value)**, and **C (Low-Value)** categories to prioritize management efforts. |
| **Dead Stock Analysis** | Tracked the non-moving inventory over the 8-week period to confirm which products were contributing to dead stock. |

## 💡 Key Findings

The analysis of the dashboard revealed several critical insights:

- **Top Performers vs. Dead Stock:**
  - ✅ **Category A (High Revenue):** **Titan** (watches) and **Ajanta** (clocks) are the clear best-sellers, driving the majority of revenue.
  - ❌ **Category C (Dead Stock):** **Tommy Hilfiger** and **Citizen** products sell in extremely low volumes and their unsold inventory is steadily increasing.

- **Peak Sales Days:**
  - 📈 Sales and footfall are consistently highest at the start and end of the business week, specifically on **Mondays** and **Fridays**.

- **Inventory Imbalance:**
  - ⚠️ A significant portion of the store's capital is tied up in Category C items that contribute less than 10% of the total revenue.

## ✅ Strategic Recommendations

Based on the findings, the following actionable recommendations were proposed to the store owner.

### **Inventory & Stock Optimization**
| Recommendation | Rationale & Action | Priority |
| :--- | :--- | :---: |
| **Adopt Data-Driven Restocking** | Shift budget away from slow-moving Category C brands and increase investment in proven Category A best-sellers. | High |
| **Implement Clearance Sales** | Introduce a **20-30% discount** on aged Category C stock to quickly liquidate inventory and free up capital. | High |
| **Create Bundle Offers** | Pair a slow-moving watch (e.g., Tommy Hilfiger) with a fast-moving one (e.g., Titan) as a combo deal. | Medium |

### **Sales & Growth Strategy**
| Recommendation | Rationale & Action | Priority |
| :--- | :--- | :---: |
| **Target Peak Sales Days** | Launch targeted promotions like "Monday Madness" or "Friday Flash Deals" to maximize revenue on high-traffic days. | High |
| **Digitize Sales Records** | Transition from the `Khata Book` to a simple digital tool like Google Sheets for continuous performance tracking. | High |
